# CodeSentinel_ContactBook

## 📌 Task Description
This is **Task 2** of my Python Programming Virtual Internship at **Code Sentinel**.  
The task is to create a **Simple Contact Book** that:
- Lets the user add a contact (Name & Phone Number)
- Saves contacts to a `contacts.txt` file
- Allows viewing saved contacts from the file

## 🛠 Concepts Used
- **File Handling (open, read, write)** for persistent data storage
- **while loops** for continuous menu interaction
- **String handling** to store and retrieve contact information
- **Basic input/output** for user interaction

---

## 📜 Code Explanation
- **`add_contact()`** → Adds a contact and stores it in `contacts.txt` in `Name,Phone` format  
- **`view_contacts()`** → Reads and displays contacts from the file  
- **`main()`** → Provides a menu-driven interface (Add, View, Exit)
