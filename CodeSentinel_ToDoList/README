# CodeSentinel_ToDoList

## 📌 Task Description
This is **Task 3** of my Python Programming Virtual Internship at **Code Sentinel**.  
The task is to create a **To-Do List Application** that:
- Adds new tasks
- Removes tasks
- Displays the list of tasks
- Saves tasks to `tasks.json` for persistent storage
- Loads saved tasks when the program starts


## 🛠 Concepts Used
- **JSON module** for structured data storage  
- **File Handling (open, read, write)** for saving and loading tasks  
- **Lists** for storing multiple tasks in memory  
- **Functions** for clean and modular code design  
- **while loops** for continuous menu interaction

## 📜 Code Explanation
- **`load_tasks()`** → Loads tasks from `tasks.json` (creates file if not present)  
- **`save_tasks()`** → Saves the updated list of tasks to `tasks.json`  
- **`add_task()`** → Adds a task to the list and saves it  
- **`remove_task()`** → Removes a task based on the user’s selection  
- **`view_tasks()`** → Displays all tasks with numbering  
- **`main()`** → Handles the main menu (Add, Remove, View, Exit)
